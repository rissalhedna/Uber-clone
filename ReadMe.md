## Introduction
In this project, we will use React Native and Expo to replicate the front end of the popular ride-sharing app Uber. Our goal is to create a mobile app that has the basic functionalities of the Uber app, including the ability to request rides, view driver information, and track the ride in real-time.

By using React Native and Expo, we will be able to develop a cross-platform app that can be used on both iOS and Android devices. Expo provides a set of tools and services that make it easier to develop and distribute React Native apps, allowing us to focus on building the app itself.

In addition to the core features of the Uber app, we will also use Google Maps APIs to display the map and calculate distances between locations. This will allow us to provide accurate information to users and ensure that the app functions properly.

We also plan to develop an "UberEats" section in the future, which will allow users to order food and have it delivered to their location. This will expand the functionality of the app and provide an additional service to users.

## Tools
To achieve our goals, we will use a variety of tools and technologies, including:

1. React Native: a framework for building cross-platform mobile applications using JavaScript
2. Expo: a set of tools and services for developing and distributing React Native apps
3. Google Maps APIs: a collection of APIs for displaying maps, calculating distances, and other location-based services
